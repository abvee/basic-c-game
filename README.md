# Game in C
Hello, welcome to me trying to make a simple game in C.

In the book, 'The C Programming Language', at the end of the tutorial
chapter, (chapter 1), this is written:
```
At this point we have covered what might be called the conventional core
of C. With this handful of building blocks, it's possible to write
useful programs of considerable size, and it would probably be a good
idea if you paused long enough to do so.
```

Simply, this game is something that I will try to make, and progress it
with new information I learn every chapter...
